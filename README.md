# Hotspot-Detection

### Description
The Hotspot Detector project is a machine learning-based initiative aimed at identifying hotspots within a defined geographic region. Leveraging a variety of algorithms, including K-Means, Birch, Gaussian Mixture Model, Hierarchical Clustering, and Mean-Shift Clustering, the project employs sophisticated clustering techniques to pinpoint areas of interest. Validation of the algorithmic results is conducted using robust metrics such as the Silhouette Score and Heatmap.

### Uses
This model can be utilized as per specific requirements, including:
- **Crime Hotspots**: Identifying areas with high crime rates to optimize the deployment of security services.
- **Taxi Hotspots**: Identifying locations with high demand for taxis but limited supply, enabling the strategic placement of taxi drivers.

### Accuracy
The Hierarchical Clustering algorithm exhibited outstanding performance, achieving a silhouette score of 0.943. This indicates the model's exceptional ability to accurately identify and delineate hotspots within the specified area.
